Many communities have a formal process by which a citizen may challenge the public availability of a work. This list of most commonly challenged books in the United States lists some of the books challenged from 1990 to 1999 in the United States.[1] This article is missing information about the most commonly challenged books outside the 1990s. This concern has been noted on the talk page where whether or not to include such information may be discussed.

"How To Be Listed on Dow Jones Industrial Average---","How To Be Listed on Dow Jones Industrial Average------Heres a look at the current holdings in the Dow Jones: Current Holdings Dow Jones The most common criticism of the Dow is that it only represents 30 companies yet its recognized as The market indicator.? Even though the S&P 500 represents the top 500 US companies and is a better reflection of our economy, when people ask me about the market, I assure you its not the s&P 500. It never fails that everyday I get the question, How did the market do? or Hows the market doing?.? The market that everybody is always referring to is the Dow Jones Industrial Average.? The Dow (for short) was founded May 26, 1896 initially only having 12 companies from important American industries (hence: Industrial average).? The Dow currently reflects the top 30 U.S. Companies across its various industries.? To compute the Dow that you hear about each day, a lengthy geometric formula is used that takes the price-weighted? stock price of each company and divides by the DJIA divisor.? The divisor is a number that is constantly adjust to reflect stock splits, mergers, and dividend payments.? What is the Dow Jones? The Dow Jones Industrial average is heading for a imminent change with the expected bankruptcy filing of auto giant General Motors. With the falling out of the once legendary blue chip stock, many of my clients have inquired to how companies get listed on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and when are they replaced.? I thought---When Does a Stock Get Dropped from the Dow? A stock is dropped from the Dow Jones when it seems warranted.?? As mentioned before, General Motors is presumed to be soon removed from the Dow especially if it files for bankruptcy.? A likely candidate to join GM is (former) banking giant Citigroup. .? Here are some of the more notable changes in recent history: September 22, 2008: Kraft Foods replaced AIG (American International Group) February 19, 2008:? (My wifes bday ? Chevron and Bank of America replaced Altria Group and Honeywell April 8, 2004: Pfizer, Verizon, and AIG replaced International Paper, AT&T, and Eastman Kodak Who Will Replace GM? GM out of the Dow? There arent any preset rules on how a company gets replaced on the Dow.?? Looking at past replacements, typically the Dow does not replace an exiting company with another in its same industry.? Currently, there are several speculations on which company is going to replace them.? A few possibilities include: Cisco, Visa, Amazon, Wells Fargo, and mother Google.? Time will tell. Update: Cisco and Travelers Co. will be replacing GM and Citi at the end of trading June 8, 2009. Securities offered through LPL Financial, Member FINRA/SIPC"

"Birdwatching Trip Report from Uganda---","Birdwatching Trip Report from Uganda------We followed the itinerary outlined below: Strategy and tips We found the people of Uganda to be very welcoming and experienced no trouble of any kind. The recent successful attacks on the Lords Republican Army by the UPDF in the Sudan are likely to signal the end of this movement and may ensure that the Foreign Office advisory against travel to and within Murchison Falls NP will soon be lifted. We could not heed Sam Woods' excellent advice re timing of trips due to other commitments but can only reinforce what he says on the subject. July/August is great for seeing grassland species (eg bishops and widows) in full plumage, and the weather is benign, but it is a very hard time to be birding generally, especially during dry spells. We had little response to tapes and found things very difficult, especially at Bwindi. Consider going in April/May (during short wet season) or September (just at start of big wet) for better birding (although the roads may be tricky at this time - best to check with Herbert). African green broadbill nests are usually located in April/May and staked out at Mubwindi. We flew with British Airways - booking well in advance secured the best seat prices (?560). Remember to get a visa in advance - available for Uganda High Commission in London - and do check that you are up to date with all your vaccinations.

For example, an ""unexpected T_ENCAPSED_AND_WHITESPACE"" error is produced by the following code: <?php $main_output_world = 'snakes!'; echo('There are' 10 $main_output_world); ?> Note the missing concatenation operator between the two strings leads to the whitespace error that is so named above. The concatenation operator instructs PHP to ignore the whitespace between the two code tokens (the so named ""encapsed"" data""), rather than parse it as a token itself. The correct code would be: <?php $main_output_world = 'snakes!'; echo('There are' . 10 . $main_output_world); ?> Note the addition of the concatenation operator between each token."

We are unable to provide digital versions. Victor R. Baker is Regents Professor in Hydrology and Water Resources at the University of Arizona, USA, and holds joint chairs in the departments of Geosciences and Planetary Sciences there. His research interests broadly concern palaeohydrology and related aspects of geomorphology, with a particular focus on flood processes. He also works in the area of planetary geomorphology and on issues that involve Earth science in relation to public policy, the environment and philosophy of science. An excellent resource for graduate and post-graduate level courses in hydrology and hydro-geomorphology, reproducing many important papers that are otherwise difficult to access. Palaeolakes were found to afford information central to understanding past climate in the 1960s and three seminal papers are included. Palaeobotanical evidence to aid palaeohydrological work originated in the 1960s, and Sigafoos (1964) is a significant contribution. Palaeoflood Hydrology brings together the papers that mark the development from geological investigation of flood-scarred landscapes to a broader, global science rooted in environmental change studies. Megafloods are high-discharge (>106 m3/s) flood flows now known to have been especially important at the end of the Pleistocene, but in 1923, Bretzâs hypothesis of such âcataclysmic flowsâ? was controversial. Sediment Transport shows how engineering/geomorphologic underÂ¬standing of sediment processes was initially used to back-calculate the flows associated with fluvial events.

He has served on the department a total of 47 years, and will continue as a member, but turned the ChiefÂs duties over to Assistant Chief Rudi Jensen. The formal reception at the Village Hall was followed by an informal gathering with lunch at the Riverside Bar, sponsored by Crivitz Fire Association. Among dignitaries participating in the formal portion of the evening were Village President John Deschane, State Representative Jeff Mursau; Chief Kevin Bierce of Pewaukee Fire Department, representing the Wisconsin State Fire ChiefÂs Association; Danielle Weddel, President of Crivitz Rescue Squad, and Crivitz Fire Department Assistant Chief, Luke Deschane, who gave the keynote address.

"Patent US5553422 - Glass restraint system for windows - Google Patents---","Patent US5553422 - Glass restraint system for windows - Google Patents------Patent Citations Although several alternative embodiments of the present invention have been described above, it will be appreciated that certain alterations and modifications thereof will become apparent to those skilled in the art. For example, a similar structure and assembly could be used to secure glass panes within doors. It is therefore intended that the appended claims be interpreted as covering all such alterations and modifications as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. The objective of this embodiment is, like that depicted in FIG. 5, to better secure the film edges to the window frame by folding it back over the base strip and clamping it between the base strip and the cap strip. While two embodiments accomplishing this objective are illustrated, it is understood that many other folding and clamping configurations could be used. The configuration depicted in FIG. 6 is preferred because during installation, rotation of cap 520 into place aids in the folding of the somewhat stiff film material over the base strip and does not allow the film edge to bunch up under the cap. Note that forces applied to film 500 tending to pull it from beneath base 503 will be transferred to cap 520 as the film tries to unseat rib 536 from slot 510. However, it will be apparent that such rightward force (as illustrated) will tend to bias cap 520 rightwardly effecting an even tighter lock---* Cited by examiner Referenced by Citing Patent Filing date Publication date Applicant Title US5778629 * Dec 11, 1996 Jul 14, 1998 Howes; Stephen E.

"Exiled from GROGGS---","Exiled from GROGGS------One of the things that I find quite pleasing about the approach I have taken is that, rather than the values obtained from an opinion poll being used as inputs (""What would 34% of the electorate supporting both Labour and Conservative mean?"") it actually becomes one of the outputs - in effect, a correspondence between the opinion poll results and the total votes cast per party in the model provides a validation of the assumptions that I have made about how the votes have been redistributed. The downside is that it gives a misleading sense of confidence. A reminder of the results that came out of the model run above: The trouble is that, as with psychohistory, the model can't deal with details and individuals - for example, a very charismatic candidate in one constituency; an issue that polarises local populations. In effect, I make the assumption that on a national level the impact of such things is likely to be small over a five year period. There will be local variations, but as far as the model is concerned, they can be ignored, as what I am trying to get out of the model is not so much a forecast for each individual constituency but an estimate of how large-scale---The problem is that, even assuming that I get close to being right about the number of votes, the number of ways of arranging those votes is indefinitely large. The opinion poll output is very low in information: the size of parties in parliament much higher. Is it possible to determine how reasonable any specific arrangement is? Incidentally, I have no doubt that there's nothing terribly unusual about this model - political parties and media organisations almost certainly do the same thing. I was just interested in the fact that it could be put together in about an evening using nothing more than spreadsheet software. I'd like next to spend some time refining the model. I think that a more general matrix for transfer of allegiance can be constructed, though I'm not sure how much it would add. I would like to get closer to the actual poll standings - though this is quite scary, I hammered the Lib-Dem vote even to get it down to 11%, and I still have some votes to lose from Conservative and Labour. And maybe I should be trying to look at ""Other"" or something, more usefully than BNP. And would it be possible to determine which constituencies actually have a Green candidate standing in them? And then, just how varied could the size of parties in the House of Commons be and still return the headline poll figure? And is the poll"

"Difference between revisions of ""AFF Developers Guide"" - ForensicsWiki---","Difference between revisions of ""AFF Developers Guide"" - ForensicsWiki------The following status codes can be returned by AFF functions. AFF Return Values Pages AFF files can be viewed as a series of name/value pairs. Segments AFF Concepts This final line closes the file handle and destroys the AFFILE structure.  af_close(af);  This line uses one of the miscellaneous functions included with the AFF to display the size of the uncompressed image stored in the file. Compare the value displayed by this line to the size of the AFF image on the disk and you can see how much the library compresses. The example file zeros.aff shows an extreme case!  af_get_imagesize(af));  printf (""The uncompressed size of this file isÂ %""PRId64"" bytes\n"", This line attempts to open the given file using the af_open command. The O_RDONLY is one of many macros defined in fcntl.h that can be used when opening files. The final parameter specifies whether or not the file must be created. This normally only applies when writing AFF files, so it's safe to leave it as zero here. The function returns a pointer to an AFFILE structure. There are some public data fields in that structure defined in afflib.h.  } return TRUE; perror(fn); { if (NULL == af)  AFFILE * af = af_open(fn,O_RDONLY,0); These two lines include the necessary headers to use the AFF. Although fcntl.h is not actually required, it provides several macros that are highly recommended.---AFF Function Reference Stream Functions af_open  AFFILE * af_open(const char *filename, int flags, int mode); The flags parameter controls what the program should be allowed to do with the file. There are a set of handy macros defined in fcntl.h that you should use. When reading files, using O_RDONLY is usually sufficient. When writing an AFF file, it is best to use O_CREAT|O_RDWR. The mode parameter is only used when creating a new file (RBF â and only on *nix?). It controls the It should be noted here that when writing AFF files, the af_open command does more than just open a file handle. When writing, the af_open command causes the default AFF header to be written to the file on the disk. RBF â What happens, when opening for write, if the file already exists? RBF â Which parts of the header are written by default? See open(3) af_open_stdin  AFFILE * af_open_stdin(void); A special case of af_open, this function an AFF handle on standard input. Note that this function did not appear until AFF version 2.3. Also note that if you are working on the Windows platform (or plan to support the Windows platform) you need to explicitly tell the compiler to treat standard input as a stream of binary data.

"Seattle Shorelines Rising: Waterfront Home Sales Up 28.9% For 2012 - Seattle Waterfront Homes---","Seattle Shorelines Rising: Waterfront Home Sales Up 28.9% For 2012 - Seattle Waterfront Homes------Top Waterfront Real Estate Sales in the city of Seattle, 2012 The waterfront homes at the top end of the market also saw marked increases in sales. Â Sales of waterfront homes over $1 million increased 6.25 percent for the year, while multi-million dollar sales were up 20.5% percent over the same period. Â The top King County sale for the year was an estate known as âHarmony at Proctor Laneâ? in Mercer Island. Â The nearly 3-acre estate has 324 feet of Lake Washington shoreline and sold for $21.625 million. Â Sales in the city of Seattle topped out at $3.3 million at Webster Point in Laurelhurst. There were 863 waterfront homes sold in King County in 2012, up from 669 in 2011. Â That 28.9 percent increase is anÂ unmistakable trend in the right direction for waterfront real estate, which makes up a significant percentage of the luxury real estate in the greater Seattle area.

UGA is a great school with an amazing campus and student life and Athens is a fabulous city. I really encourage all students to get out there and see what UGA and Athens has to offer! Also, I reccommend Dawg Camp to any students who have been accepted. It's just so much fun! You meet a lot of people and have the time of your life learning about all that UGA has to offer! Bang for the buck If you are a student from the state of Georgia and you are HOPE scholarship eligible, you definitely get the most bang for your buck because you don't pay tuition! It's really a great deal! It gives you plenty of incentive to keep your grades up and maintain your 3.0, or as my friends and I like to say, Keep HOPE alive! If you are a student coming to UGA from a state other than Georgia, it is definitely more expensive for you than it is for students who receive HOPE, but I do think it is a lot cheaper than a lot of other schools. Also, according to me, being a student at UGA is so great, a price can't even be"

It is apparent that various changes may be made in the form, construction, and arrangement of parts thereof without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention, or sacrificing all of its material advantages.

This program was best for me because with the online program, I am able to log onto my classroom discussion and assignments on my own time. It is very helpful in keeping my daily priorities organized and in the correct order. Tips for prospective students It is helpful to stay motivated and have a stable back up plan. If online, make sure to always have access to the internet and classrooms. If on campus, it is good to be self-motivated and keep track of materials and schedules. Bang for the"

Accordingly, the scope of the present invention should not be limited by the particular embodiments described above, but should be defined only by the claims set forth below and equivalents thereof. Additional sleep-related signals may be sensed and used to improve the sleep detection mechanism described above. For example, a posture sensor may be used to detect the posture of the patient and used to confirm sleep. If the posture sensor indicates a vertical posture, then the posture sensor signal may be used to override a determination of sleep using the sleep detection and threshold adjustment signals. Other signals may also be used in connection with sleep determination or confirmation, including the representative set of sleep-related signals associated with sleep indicated above. illustrates adjustment of the accelerometer sleep threshold using the MV signal. The initial sleep threshold 910 is established using the baseline accelerometer signal data acquired as discussed above. If the patient's MV signal is low relative to an expected MV level associated with sleep, the accelerometer sleep threshold is increased 920. If the patient's MV signal level is high relative to an expected MV level associated with sleep, the accelerometer sleep threshold is decreased 930. When the patient's MV level is high, less activity detected by the accelerometer is---US8571656 Dec 13, 2010 Oct 29, 2013 Cardiac Pacemakers, Inc.

Unable to eclipse Rick Nielsen and company, they setteled in comfortably with a few domestic top 40 hits, Full Moon and Stay In Time.

How many teams, in the span of 4 years, have seen statistical failures as big as the 2007 and 2010 Padres? (Jed Hoyer from San Diego) Gene Mauch to one side, I don't think managers deserve all the blame for late-season collapses. The Padres skid was definitely terrible, and losing 10 games straight is a good way to blow it. But the players played--and lost--those games. Other than Adrian Gonzalez (who hit .361/.439/.528 in those 10 games), the team just plain stunk. Some of that is on Black, but more of it is just on bad play.

Be sure to join #kde-bugs on irc.freenode.net, as this is where the bug-day will be coordinated. (You can even join now!) Some more information on how to mark bugs can be found on This page. Some bugs may not be reproducible on every installation of KDE. Thus we use a 4-eye principle, having at least 2 triagers look at the bugs before we make any changes on the bugs themselves. If a bug's description is somewhat unclear, try to provide a better step-by-step procedure on how to reproduce it. This will make it easier for developers to find and fix the bug. Check if bugs reported for Dolphin which are previously UNCONFIRMED are reproducible. [edit] Goals of this Bug Day This bug day will take place on Sunday, August 1st 2010, but feel free to start early. The aim of this bug day is to get as many Dolphin-related bugs done as possible.

"Patent US5444816 - Dynamic codebook for efficient speech coding based on algebraic codes - Google Patents---","Patent US5444816 - Dynamic codebook for efficient speech coding based on algebraic codes - Google Patents------Patent Citations Although a preferred embodiment of the present invention has been described in detail hereinabove, this embodiment can be modified at will, within the scope of the appended claims, without departing from the nature and spirit of the invention. As an example, many types of algebraic codes can be chosen to achieve the same goal of reducing the search complexity while many types of adaptive prefilters can be used. Also the invention is not limited to the treatment of a speech signal; other types of sound signal can be processed. Such modifications, which retain the basic principle of combining an algebraic code generator with a adaptive prefilters, are obviously within the scope of the subject invention. The drastic complexity reduction that the present invention offers when compared to the prior art techniques comes from the fact that the search procedure can be brought back to Ak-code space by a modification of the so called backward filtering formulation. In this approach the search reduces to finding the index k for which the ratio |DAk.sup.Ï |/Î±k is the largest. In this ratio, Ak is a fixed target signal and Î±k is an energy term the computation of which can be done with very few operations by codeword when N, the number of non zero components of the codeword Ak, is small. Accordingly, the present invention provides a fully quantized Algebraic Code Excited Linear Prediction (ACELP) vocoder giving near toll---Jan 19, 1988 Itt Defense Communications A Division Of Itt Corporation Digital speech coding circuit US4724535 * Apr 16, 1985 Feb 9, 1988 Nec Corporation Low bit-rate pattern coding with recursive orthogonal decision of parameters US4742550 * Sep 17, 1984 May 3, 1988 Motorola, Inc. 4800 BPS interoperable relp system US4764963 * Jan 12, 1987 Aug 16, 1988 American Telephone And Telegraph Company, At&T Bell Laboratories Speech pattern compression arrangement utilizing speech event identification US4771465 * Sep 11, 1986 Sep 13, 1988 American Telephone And Telegraph Company, At&T Bell Laboratories Digital speech sinusoidal vocoder with transmission of only subset of harmonics US4797925 * Sep 26, 1986 Jan 10, 1989 Bell Communications Research, Inc.

"Surry County, North Carolina - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia---","Surry County, North Carolina - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia------Pilot Mountain Another notable peak in Surry County is Cumberland Knob, in the northwest corner of the county, which was the starting point of the construction of the Blue Ridge Parkway. The following table provides a list of some of the more prominent mountains of the county. Surry County is located both within the Piedmont region of central North Carolina and in the Appalachian Mountains region of western North Carolina. Most of the eastern two-thirds of the county lies within the Piedmont, a region of gently rolling hills and valleys. However, the Piedmont of Surry County also contains a small portion of the Sauratown Mountains; Surry County marks the western end of the Sauratown Mountain range. The western third of the county lies within the Blue Ridge Mountains, and they dominate the county's western horizon. The mountain passes (called ""gaps"" locally) are notorious for their occasional high winds, which can force automobiles and even large Eighteen wheeler trucks off the highways which lead through the passes. As a result, high wind advisories issued by the National Weather Service are not uncommon. The highest point in Surry County is Fisher Peak in---Rivers[edit] While there are many creeks and streams in Surry County, there are three recognized major rivers in the county, the Ararat, the Fisher, and the Mitchell. All three flow southward and are tributaries of the Yadkin River, which forms the southern border of Surry County. The Yadkin River is the northern component of the Pee Dee River which flows to the Atlantic Ocean near Georgetown, South Carolina.

Accordingly, this invention should be read broadly in light of the combination of the buoyancy compensator belt 72, the buoyancy compensator 10 and the aspects pertaining thereto in a singular, as well as a combined form. In addition to the foregoing attachment means of the buoyancy compensator belt 72 to the buoyancy compensator 10, various other means such as hooks, eyelets, straps, webs, elastomeric straps, or any other suitable means can be used to allow the buoyancy compensator 10 to be interconnected to the buoyancy compensator belt 72, while at the same time allowing it to expand and contract. The thought being that the buoyancy compensator belt 72 should not be directly adhered to the buoyancy compensator so that there is not give and play between the buoyancy compensator 10 and buoyancy compensator belt 72. Thus, there should be play or give between the two to allow for the expansion and contraction of the buoyancy compensator belt 72 to provide the net result of accommodating the expansion of the buoyancy compensator belt 72.

"Impact of FTAs on Canadian Auto Industry---Table 7: Absolute changes","Impact of FTAs on Canadian Auto Industry---Table 7: Absolute changes---The production breakdown in the last five columns of TableÂ 1 also tells an interesting story. Toyota and Honda are now the most Canadian of all firms. Both produce approximately half of their sales locally. The fraction for GM dropped below 20% and for Ford it even approached 10%, but it will rebound now that the St. Thomas plant has been closed (in September, 2011) which produced mostly for export. Overall, exactly 20% of all vehicles sold in Canada are produced domestically. Given that total Canadian sales only make up 11% of the entire integrated NAFTA market this is still a higher than proportional fraction. Somewhat surprisingly given the overall economic climate, the luxury brands have done extremely well, with large increases in the market shares of Volkswagen (Audi), BMW, Daimler (Mercedes-Benz), and Subaru. Also, Daimler is now again independent from Chrysler. Together with the strong performance of Nissan, it is likely that the market shares of different firms with converge further. As a result, the market has become much more leveled. Sales of the top firm in Canada (Ford) are less than double the sales of the firm in the number six spot (Honda). The combined sales of the top six groups is now over three quarters of the market, with no firm dominating. Total sales for the Canadian market in 2010, in units and market share, as well as the growth in sales over the last five years are depicted in the first three columns of TableÂ 1.

Congressman Fortenberry was opposed by Democrat Ivy Harper, a journalist and a legislative assistant to former Congressman John Cavanaugh. Harper did not stand much chance in this district, and Fortenberry was overwhelmingly re-elected.

Congressman Terry faced a tough bid for re-election in 2008 from Democrat Jim Esch, but Esch declined to run for Congress a third time in 2010. Instead, State Senator Tom White emerged as the Democratic nominee. Though polls indicated the race to be close and Democrats saw the 2nd district as one of their few pick-up opportunities,[3] Congressman Terry was ultimately re-elected by a wide margin on election day.

After much frustration I tried an on-line search and found House Plants 4 Less. What struck me so fine was the attention to detail in descriptions and photographs for so many plants! I not only found my special plant, I was tickled to order several more that I've always wanted but could never find anywhere else! There are so many plants available from House Plants 4 Less that your fancy will be tickled as mine was! My plants arrived in such unique and precise packaging - they looked better than plants I have seen at the flower shop! Each plant was individually wrapped in such a way that kept the pot, the soil, and the plant completely safe and clean. The plant's sizes are generous, budding profusely, and in all the beautiful shades of green exhibiting new life and healthy plant growth. The plants come pre-fertilized and watered -- no detail is overlooked in order to transport a healthy plant. I not only recommend this vendor heartily, I have decided that all of my future gifts in this category will be with Bobby and company at House Plants 4 Less! There is nothing like knowing a gift you send is going to arrive in perfect condition! And,"

Do not use them to identify or resolve performance issues. Ping and traceroute are two of the most useful tools for troubleshooting TCP/IP networking problems. The ping utility generates a series of echo packets to a destination across a TCP/IP internetwork. When the echo packets arrive at the destination, they are rerouted and sent back to the source. Using ping, you can verify connectivity to a particular destination across an IP routed network. The traceroute utility operates in a similar fashion, but can also determine the specific path that a frame takes to its destination on a hop-by-hop basis. These tools have been migrated to Fibre Channel for use with the Cisco MDS 9000 Family switches and are called FC ping and FC traceroute. You can access FC ping and FC traceroute from the CLI or from Fabric Manager. This section contains the following topics: Using FC Ping Using FC Traceroute"

"HLA Nomenclature @ hla.alleles.org---","HLA Nomenclature @ hla.alleles.org------Table 1: New Sequences All new and confirmatory sequences should now be submitted directly to the WHO Nomenclature Committee for Factors of the HLA System via the IMGT/HLA Database using the sequence submission tool provided. The IMGT/HLA Database may be accessed via the world wide web at : http://www.ebi.ac.uk/imgt/hla/. Below are listed the newly assigned sequences (Table 1) and confirmations of previously reported sequences (Table 2). The accession number of each sequence is given and these can be used to retrieve the sequence files from either the EMBL, GenBank or DDBJ data libraries. Although accession numbers have been assigned by the data libraries and most sequences are already available, there is still the possibility that an author may not yet have allowed the sequence to be released, in such a case you will have to contact the submitting author directly. Additional information pertaining to new sequences is often included in the publications describing these alleles, a listing of recent publications which describe new HLA sequences is given in Table 3. The following sequences have been submitted to the Nomenclature Committee since the April 2007 nomenclature update and, following agreed policy, have been assigned official allele designations. Full details of all sequences will be published in a forthcoming report.

"Patent US20030195935 - System and method for authenticating electronic documents - Google Patents---","Patent US20030195935 - System and method for authenticating electronic documents - Google Patents------Patent Citations [0089] A skilled person will appreciate that variations of the disclosed arrangements are possible without departing from the invention. Accordingly, the above description of several embodiments is made by way of example and not for the purposes of limitation. It will be clear to the skilled person that minor modifications can be made without significant changes to the operation described above. [0088] An advantage of the present invention is that it provides a system in which individuals are the authorised users, not machines. Hence, if for example a user logged into his pc, but left it unattended, a third party could not send an authenticated e-mail. A further advantage is that the use of a biometric characteristic means that the user does not need to carry around additional equipment or even remember a code number. This means that the system is much simpler for user to operate. In addition, the system is easy to adapt to user's needs. [0087] Whilst the biometric reader is shown in the accompanying drawings as being in a unit that is separate to the pc, it will be understood that it could equally be included in the main body of the pc itself. Alternatively, the sensor could be incorporated into, for example, the keyboard or the mouse of the pc. [0086] The systems described above specifically use pcs for sending---* Cited by examiner Referenced by Citing Patent Filing date Publication date Applicant Title US7254619 * Oct 5, 2001 Aug 7, 2007 Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd.

"Medical College, Calicut---","Medical College, Calicut------The department of psychiatry had a humble beginning at Medical College Hospital towards the end of 1960âs. In the initial years of its existence only OP services were there. In the early 1980s a few male beds and later a female ward with 17 beds were allotted to the department. In the later part of 1990s the department started 3 speciality clinics (Deaddiction, suicide prevention, child and Adolescent mental health clinics) and these clinics are effectively functioning with its various activities. A major milestone of development was witnessed in 2001 May when the new male ward with 12 beds and a Deaddiction Ward with 18 Beds were opened to the public. With the expansion of facilities, the utility by public also have increased. In recent years increasing number of patients are availing the various facilities of the Department. SUCCESSION LIST OF HEADS OF DEPARTMENTSÂ Â  About us Psychiatry is a field of Medicine which deals with the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of mental, emotional and behavioural disorders. It is concerned with the disorders of a personâs mental life and behaviour. It integrates biological, social and psychological aspects of mental health to provide holistic medical care for a wide range of symptoms. It is increasingly clear in todayâs world that disorders of mental health are becoming more significant and represent significant personal and social costs to the community. There is a disturbing increase in the number of persons with mental health problems in the community.---Copyright Â© 2010 - All Rights Reserved - Calicut Medical College alevi kral oyun film izle free Videos sex videos avon galaxy OyunlarÄ± technology haber son dakika alevi haber seo uzmani Ã§iÄli Ã§iÃ§ek Ã§iÄli pide izmir escort izmir eskort izmir escort izmir eskort izmir escort izmir eskort izmir escort izmir eskort sarÄ±yer evden eve nakliyat kemerburgaz evden eve nakliyat beylikdï¿½ï¿½zï¿½ï¿½ evden eve nakliyat ÅiÅli evden eve nakliyat kagithane evden eve nakliyat"

"Capturing RSE Legendaries - Smogon University---","Capturing RSE Legendaries - Smogon University------Kyogre's Maximum Stats (Level 45) After headlining in Sapphire, Kyogre decides to make a splash in Emerald, but in a new home that is constantly changing location. Kyogre can be caught in Marine Cave after defeating the Elite Four by speaking to a scientist on the second floor of the Weather Institute on Route 119. When you speak with him, the scientist will inform that it is raining heavily on a certain route. Immediately head to the route the scientist mentioned, as it will change if you let too much time pass, and don't forget to bring a PokÃ©mon with Dive. Upon your arrival, you will notice heavy rain, indicating that Marine Cave is in the area. Search for a dark patch on the water and Dive to enter Marine Cave. Kyogre is at level 70 when you battle it; remember to save before stepping directly in front of Kyogre. Kyogre is the mascot for PokÃ©mon Sapphire, and is located at the bottom of the Cave of Origin in Sootopolis City in that game. Kyogre will arrive at the Cave of Origin once Archie awakens it at the Seafloor Cavern on Route 128. Head over to Sootopolis City once the events at the Seafloor Cavern have passed. When you arrive, you will be led to the Cave of Origin by Steven and Wallace and asked to confront Kyogre to end the perpetual rainfall. The Cave of Origin itself is a simple 5-floor dungeon. The first four floors are shrouded in---Kyogre's Minimum Speed (Level 45) Min- Min Min+ 77 86 94 Kyogre's Moveset (Level 45) Body Slam (15 PP) Calm Mind (20 PP) Ice Beam (10 PP) Hydro Pump (5 PP) Total PP = 50 The biggest threat in Kyogre's arsenal is Hydro Pump with its 120 Base Power, coupled with Kyogre's massive Special Attack and the perpetual rain caused by Drizzle. With the boost from rain, Hydro Pump can tear through most PokÃ©mon, especially at this point in the game, where your team is likely not at a high level. Luckily, Hydro Pump only has 5 PP, so Kyogre won't get too many chances to KO your PokÃ©mon with it. Calm Mind makes Hydro Pump more lethal and Ice Beam a serious threat after some boosts. Body Slam won't be doing as much damage compared to any of Kyogre's other moves, but it does have a decent 30% chance of inflicting paralysis.

Examples---Military service Main article: [edit] Countries with and without mandatory military service In Israel, the Muslim and Christian Arab minority are exempt from mandatory service, as are permanent residents such as the Druze of the Golan Heights. Male Ultra-Orthodox Jews may apply for a deferment of draft to study in Yeshiva, and the deferment tends to become an exemption, while female religious Jews can be exempted after presenting ""religious declaration"" to the IDF authorities, and some (primarily National Religious or Modern Orthodox) choose to volunteer for national service instead. Male Druze and Circassian Israeli citizens are liable, by agreement with their community leaders (Female Druze and Circassian are exempt from service). Members of the exempted groups can still volunteer, but very few do, except for the Bedouin where a relatively large number have tended to volunteer (usually for financial reasons). Toward the end of the US draft, an attempt was made to make the system somewhat fairer by turning it into a lottery, with each of the year's calendar dates randomly assigned a number. Men born on lower numbered dates were called up for review. For the reasons given above, this did not make the system any fairer, and the entire system ended in 1973. By 1975, the draft was no longer mandatory. Today, American men aged 18?25 are encouraged---[edit] Conscription by jurisdiction Conscription in Australia Conscription in Cyprus Conscription in Canada Conscription in Egypt Conscription in Finland Conscription in Germany Conscription in Gibraltar Conscription in Greece Conscription in Israel Conscription in Malaysia Conscription in Mexico Conscription in New Zealand Conscription in Russia Conscription in Serbia Conscription in Singapore Conscription in South Korea Conscription in Switzerland Conscription in the Netherlands Conscription in the Ottoman Empire Conscription in the Republic of China(Taiwan) Conscription in the Russian Empire Conscription in the United Kingdom Conscription in the United States Conscription in Turkey Conscription in Western Sahara Taliban conscription [edit]"

"numismatic?---","numismatic?------STATISTIC TABEL    coins per year, grpuped on reigns  The situation described in the table must be analyzed (at the 2005 campaign; the discoveries of the collective coordinated by col. Vl?descu are missing from the statistic) with caution. Many of the coins are not that surely dated, and moreover, their nominal is not known. Even the way the investigation has been performed might come into discussion. The team coordinated by Tocilescu and Florescu had as main objectives the delimitation of the walls, which might make us think that they didnt paid enough attention to the early levels; from this reason, the early coins may have an under-evaluated representation. Recent investigations lead as well through the same conclusion, due to the fact that the collective coordinated by col.Vladescu left several segments of section unfinished (therefore in the detriment of early discoveries), and the actual collective investigated until now only the area of the fortification elements, without investigation in the interior of the small fort. With this necessary correction, we may now have a global perspective of the data, to make an opinion, though only summarily and, of course, provisory, on the main phases of the fort. Lets take a look at the following table:     Tudor 1965, p. 252, after Polonics notes; ""with Diva Augusta inscription""   ?     Ag Tudor 1965, p. 252, after Polonics notes; ""with NIKE inscription""   ?     Ag---    Observations Early coins, from Domitian to Trajan, are, so far, too few to assures us of the fact that this fort has been built during Trajans time. More certitude as regarding this matter may offer the situation analogy with forts from Dacia Porolissensis (Bologa, Buciumi, Gilau), which know a similar evolution and of which we know that have been founded at the end of the war. Another conjuctural element, as the presence of a tile with the stamp of V Macedonica legion (Tudor 1965, 237) may suggest the same thing. The Roman presence at Racari, during Hadrians time, seems very pale, especially if we consider the low nominal of the coins (all made of bronze). On the other hand, the stratigraphic situation from the ditch of the small fort does not recommend a complete abandonment of the fort, even only a provisory one, the ditch being only a third blocked, before its covering and levelment. Another moment of considerable presence we encounter for Antoninus Pius time (0, 44 coins per year), wherefore beginning with Marcus Aurelius reign (161-180) the presence to be once again reduced towards zero (0,11 coefficient), situation maintained along the 12 years of Commodus reign (0 coefficient). Nevertheless, sometimes during this period we should assume the construction of the large earth fort; this is pretty hard, isnt it? This matter will be resolved only through supplementary investigations, and by observing of the abundance of the 2 archaeological level"

While today has proved that this is the most disgusting, despicable and reprehensible government that this country has suffered since the last one, the overwhelming torrent of planned news to overshadow the prime minister's questioning by police has also obliterated the information commissioner's publishing of the report (PDF) into how the nation's newspapers (and magazines) are buying and selling personal and private information from government databases on a grand scale. As expected, his full listing was if anything more damning of the press in this country than the condensed one: Revealed: press buying and selling private information on a grand scale follow-up. Thursday, December 14, 2006  « Home | All that's fizzy is not explosive... » | Revealed: press buying and selling private informa... » | Scum-watch: So why isn't the tinsel up on MySpace?... » | Scum-watch: How pathetic can you get? » | Manufacturing hysteria. » | Tolerance for some, not so much for others. » | Unmistakable greed. » | Get in or get out. » | Joy to the world. » | Bringing it home. » ---(Many thanks to Spy Blog for the table.) The scale, through just this one private detective, is astounding. Best magazine, published by Hearst, had 20 different employees buying information from Stephen Whittamore, who himself was receiving the information from at least 3 others; one another private investigator, one a retired cop and the other an ""civilian communications officer"", whatever that is, who was based at Tooting police station. The information sold came at a price of at least ?75 a time; if all of Best magazine's queries cost that amount, then they alone had provided Whittamore and his associates with ?10,050. The Daily Mail's costs alone, not considering the other requests handled for other Rothermere publications, on that same equation, would have come to ?71,400. Best magazine, for those of you who like me had never heard of it, is according to the Grauniad aimed at middle-aged women. The only website I could find that's vaguely associated with it is this one here, which has the above logo with a link below to a survey which is no longer open.

One of his major honors was membership in the National Academy of Sciences of the U.S.A. The scientist carried on his research in Massachusetts, Puerto Rico, Haiti, Mexico, and California. Katherine Dexter McCormick was one of Sanger's friends and a philanthropist. He was the one to provide financial aid to Pincus, who gathered a team of scientists to work on the creation of a hormone-based substance, which would be able to imitate pregnancy. The work of Picus on the pill caught the attention of one of the most popular supporters of birth control in the United States at that time, Margaret Sanger. Besides his contribution to developing the pill, Pincus also studied the biochemistry of aging, arthritis, cancer, as well as the reaction of the adrenal system to stress.---Curiosities events funny News Banks and Finances Business - Economy New Technologies Politics Science Username: * Password: * Create"

"römisches Philae---","römisches Philae------Die größte Bedeutung hatte Philae zur Zeit der Römer. Zwei Gründe sprechen für die späte Blüte der Tempelinsel Philae. Erstens war der Isis-Kult schon vor den Römern, in der ptolemäischen Zeit, im Mittelmeerraum bekannt und hatte auch außerhalb von Ägypten seine Anhänger. Unter den Römern wurde der Isis-Kult dann erst so richtig populär. Ich möchte da nur darauf Hinweisen, dass es in Rom auf dem Marsfeld einen Isis-Tempel aus der Zeit Caligulas (38 n. Chr.) gegeben hat. Der zweite Grund war, dass sich die Römer mit dem Isis-Kult ein gewisses wohlwollen bei den nubischen Stämmen erkauften und dadurch nicht dauernd mit der Verteidigung ihrer Südgrenze beschäftigt waren. Dementsprechend waren auch die jeweiligen römischen Herrscher bemüht, zumindest ihren Namen zu hinterlassen oder gar ein Heiligtum zu stiften. So haben wir in Philae in einzigartiger Weise eine bauliche Chronologie aus der römischen Zeit vorliegen, die sonst nirgends in Ägypten zu finden ist. Wenn man jetzt den Zeitraum betrachtet, so kann man grob drei Perioden von Bautätigkeiten unterscheiden. Die erste, gleich am Beginn der römischen Herrschaft mit den Kaisern Augustus und Tiberius, die doch einiges in Philae verändert haben. Die zweite Periode mit den Kaisern Domitian, Trajan und Hadrian. Von denen kennen wir vor allen den berühmten Trajan-Kiosk und das Hadrian-Tor. Die dritte und letzte Periode mit Kaiser Diokletian mit seinem Diokletian-Tor. Dazwischen gibt es noch vereinzelnde Reliefs der anderen Kaisern, wie z.B. Kaiser Nero oder Kaiser Marc Aurel. 392 n. Chr. wurde die letzte datierbare Hieroglyphen---Literatur: Heft KEMET Jahrgang 12, Heft 1 Januar 2003 in: 32; Günther Hölbl, Altägypten im Römischen Reich in 40 - 98; © Karl Mustafa"

The always readable Andrew Gelman came up with an interesting explanation: My theory, at least for the general election, is that most of the voters have already decided who theyre going to vote forand even the ones who havent decided are often more predictable than they realize. Suppose, for example, that 40% have pretty much already decided theyll vote for the Democrat, 40% will vote for the Republican, and the fight is over the remaining 20%most of whom do not follow politics closely in any case. Now think of the audience for political news. 80% of the people dont need to know the candidates positionstheyve already decided their votesbut theyre intensely interested in the horse race: are we going to win or lose? The substantive coverage that Krugman and I might want is really just for 20% of the audience. So, from that perspective, it makes sense for the media to give people the horse"

They would later receive a medal and diploma, but not the money. Frederick Sanger is the only laureate to win the prize twice, in 1958 and 1980. Two others also won Nobel Prizes in other subjects: Marie Curie (physics in 1903, chemistry in 1911) and Linus Carl Pauling (chemistry in 1954, peace in 1962).[7] Four women have won the prize: Marie Curie, Ir?ne Joliot-Curie (1935), Dorothy Hodgkin (1964), and Ada E. Yonath (2009).[8] As of 2011, the prize has been awarded to 160 individuals. There have been eight years in which the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was not awarded.

Voting in the election was by Proportional Representation (PR) using the Single Transferable Vote (STV) system. A total of 918 candidates took part in the contest. As the election took place on the same day as the Westminster General Election it was not surprising that the general trend in results reflected the general election. The Electoral Office for Northern Ireland intend to publish a booklet with the Northern Ireland Local Government Election 2005 Results detailing the full results on a stage-by-stage basis. Due to differences in the results published by local newspapers in the days following the election the tables below should be considered as DRAFT results. The tables will be checked at a later date. Note: In the Electoral Area of Ballinderry in Cookstown District Council six candidates stood for six seats so the candidates were deemed elected without a contest. Summary of Northern Ireland Results Eligible Electorate: 1,142,433 Number of Votes Cast (Turnout / Poll): Percentage Turnout / Poll:  % Number of Invalid / Spoilt Votes: Number of Valid Votes Cast: 703,189 Percentage Valid Votes Cast: 61.55% List of candidates standing in the 2005 Westminster Election Detailed results of the 2005 Westminster Election also held on Thursday 5 May 2005 Electoral Office Northern Ireland (EONI).

"The Novel 100: The 100 Greatest Novels of All Time---","The Novel 100: The 100 Greatest Novels of All Time------What makes a listing of the greatest novels even more problematic is the lack of any consensus about which works rightfully constitute the genre... the novel is such a hybrid and adaptive genre, assimilating other prose and verse forms... A standard definition of the novel--an extended prose narrative--is so broad that it fails to limit the field usefully... I have been influenced in this regard, like many, by literary critic Ian Watt's groundbreaking 1957 study, The Rise of the Novel, which contends that the novel as a distinctive genre emerged in 18th-century England through the shifting of the emphasis of previous prose romances and their generalized and idealized characters, settings, and situations to a particularity of individual experience. In other words, the novel replaced the romance's interest in the general and the ideal with a concern for the particular. The here and now substituted for the romance's interest in the long ago and far away. As 18th-century novelist Clara Reece observed, ""The Novel is a picture of real life and manners, and of the times in which it was written. The Romance, in lofty and elevated language, describes what has never happened nor is likely to."" Novelists began to represent the actual world accurately, governed by the laws of probability. ...It would be far too reductive and misleading, however, to define the novel only by its realism or accurate representation of ordinary life...

"Wikipedia - SPIEGEL ONLINE---","Wikipedia - SPIEGEL ONLINE------Liste der weströmischen Kaiser Der Niedergang des weströmischen Kaisertums und der Stadt Rom ging einher mit dem Aufstieg der Kirche. Seit dem 5. Jahrhundert war der Einfluss des Bischofs von Rom stetig gewachsen. Im späteren 6. Jahrhundert rückte er zunehmend an die Stelle der zerfallenden weltlichen Autoritäten in der Stadt, und spätestens seit Gregor dem Großen agierte der Bischof, nunmehr als Papst, mehr oder weniger als Stadtherr Roms. In der Nachfolge der Kaiser beanspruchte er fortan als Bischof des caput mundi die Oberhoheit über die Christenheit. Um 534 dürfte die Stadt noch immer um die 100.000 Einwohner gezählt haben. Dann markierte der Krieg des oströmischen Kaisers Justinian I. gegen die Ostgoten die eigentliche Zäsur in der Stadtgeschichte: Zwischen 535 und 549 wurde Rom mehrfach belagert, die lebenswichtigen Aquädukte zerstört sowie ein Großteil der Senatoren deportiert oder getötet. Den letzten Schlag für die antiken Strukturen Italiens stellte dann der Einfall der Langobarden 568 dar, wenngleich Rom selbst nicht erobert wurde. Der weströmische Senat verschwand bald darauf (um 590). Im Mittelalter lebten nur noch höchstens 20.000 Menschen in der Stadt. Auf dem Forum Romanum, dessen letztes antikes Monument, die Phokas-Säule, 608 errichtet worden war, wurde schließlich Ackerbau betrieben. Antike Bauten dienten als Steinbruch oder wurden durch Umbauten auf niedrigem Niveau zweckentfremdet. Der Niedergang des Weströmischen Reiches machte sich auch in der Stadt Rom bemerkbar: Die Stadt, in der um 250 nach Christus über 1 Million Menschen gelebt---Legende: Farbe Bedeutung Unterkaiser oder Mitregent Gegenkaiser oder Usurpator Siehe auch Römisches Reich Spätantike Völkerwanderung Untergang des Römischen Reiches Liste der römischen Kaiser der Antike Literatur Vergleiche auch die entsprechenden Abschnitte zur späten römischen Kaiserzeit.

The always readable Andrew Gelman came up with an interesting explanation: My theory, at least for the general election, is that most of the voters have already decided who theyre going to vote forand even the ones who havent decided are often more predictable than they realize. Suppose, for example, that 40% have pretty much already decided theyll vote for the Democrat, 40% will vote for the Republican, and the fight is over the remaining 20%most of whom do not follow politics closely in any case. Now think of the audience for political news. 80% of the people dont need to know the candidates positionstheyve already decided their votesbut theyre intensely interested in the horse race: are we going to win or lose? The substantive coverage that Krugman and I might want is really just for 20% of the audience. So, from that perspective, it makes sense for the media to give people the horse"

"Systematic Political Science: A Flatfile of Countries and Territories---","Systematic Political Science: A Flatfile of Countries and Territories------The per capita income (PPP) is an estimation of the average purchasing power of individuals in international dollars.  Often, per capita income figures do not reflect purchasing power toward a monetary standard and are not as useful as those presented. When the income is observed to be disproportionately higher or lower than the potential implied by the other data usually there is an uneven distribution of resources or a bless/curse paradigm.      Literacy levels are calculated by percentages of total people; males and females over fifteen years of age that can read and write little more than their names.  Statistics are too high to be credible when large nation-states have a 99 percent or higher literacy rate.  For example, the U.S. has a significant subgroup of its population that can not read or write well enough to fill out an entry level job application form.  Those people are functionally illiterate and should be distinguished from those that are functionally literate.  *> Indicates the figure is an estimate.                Symbol IQ levels, along with other compatible data (theology, eschatology, geographic proximity etc.), can identify potential alliances and strategies such as terrorism by lower IQs toward higher IQs.  Charles Murray advises that though ""Lynn and Vanhanen are good scholars, the data for a number of smaller countries and third-world countries are inadequate to be used confidently."" However, their data is a starting point toward more---------------ALL RIGHTS RESERVED © 2007 DALLAS F. BELL, JR.----------  "

Individual resentment may also be compounded by the typically low wages paid to conscripts, especially in countries such as Greece, South Korea, Finland and Singapore. In Israel, the Muslim and Christian Arab minority, as well as many ultra-Orthodox Jews are also exempt from mandatory service. This exemption, however, does not cover Druze Israeli citizens and several Bedouin Muslim villages. Permanent residents such as the Druzes of the Golan Heights are also excused.

Methodological Notes: As I implied, I only counted contributions by players for the team(s) that retired their uniform. Therefore, players like Nolan Ryan are listed multiple times for the various teams that have honored them in this way. The contributions of players such as Babe Ruth and Wade Boggs only include the Yankees and Rays, respectively.  I do not count the retirement of Jackie Robinson's #42 (beyond, of course, the Dodgers) in the rWAR values and averages, as he did not play for those other teams. For managers whose teams have retired their uniform, I counted them only if they also played for that team, e.g. Billy Martin. Finally, vigilant reader Daniel Watkins alerted me to the fact that the Washington Nationals have recently flip-flopped on their decision to omit the four retired Expos' uniforms from their history. I have updated my original chart accordingly. See the new version below. This second chart uses the same data as the first, but de-emphasizes the long-run trends in favor of individual retirements. Note above the separate retirements of Hank Aaron's jersey as a Brave and as a Brewer. Note also the retirements of Willard Hershberger and Jim Umbricht, two players whose careers (and lives) ended in tragedy.---  Retired number list courtesy of Wikipedia. rWAR data courtesy of Baseball-Reference.com.

"Financial Planning-The Dow Jones Industrial---","Financial Planning-The Dow Jones Industrial------As of 10/01/2008 the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average were:  In fact, the day the Dow broke 10,000, on the New York Stock Exchange losing stocks outnumbered winners by a 4 to 3 ratio, and the Standard & Poor?s index of 500 major companies was down for the day. (Though the Standard & Poor?s 500 index generally is considered a more reliable market indicator than the Dow, the Dow is more widely reported.) The Dow Jones Industrial Average has historically been the average used by the masses to gauge how the Stock Market is doing. But the Dow is not always an accurate representation of the market as a whole. The Dow is no longer an average. Today the Dow is divided by a special divisor designed to avoid distortions when companies split their shares or when one stock is substituted for another. The contemporary Dow Jones Industrial was born October 1, 1928 when the list was expanded from 20 stocks to 30. Today?s Dow still uses 30 stocks to track the market, and there has been remarkably little substitution in the ensuing 71 years. On May 26, 1896, 103 years ago, Dow produced the first index composed entirely of industrials, companies producing products such as sugar, tobacco, leather, coal and electric. At that time the Dow Jones Industrial stocks were new and speculative, not ""blue chip"" stocks as they are considered to be today.

"Lake retention time - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia---","Lake retention time - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia------The residence time listed is taken from the infobox in the associated article. [edit] List of residence times of lake water Field measurements alone are usually not a reliable basis for generating residence times, mainly because they necessarily represent a small subset of locations and conditions. Therefore the measurements are generally used as the input for numerical models. In theory it would be possible to integrate a system of hydrodynamic equations with variable boundary conditions over a very long period sufficient for inflowing water particles to exit the lake. One could then calculate the traveling times of the particles using a Lagrangian method. However, this approach exceeds the detail available in current hydrodynamic models and the capacity of current computer resources. Instead, residence time models developed for gas and fluid dynamics, chemical engineering, and bio-hydrodynamics can be adapted to generate residence times for sub-volumes of lakes.[1] Two approaches can be used (often in combination) to elucidate how a particular lake works: field measurements and mathematical modeling. One common technique for field measurement is to introduce a tracer into the lake and monitor its movement. This can be a solid tracer, such as a float constructed to be neutrally buoyant within a particular water layer, or sometimes a liquid. This approach is sometimes referred to as using a---[edit] References ^ a b c Duwe, Kurt (2003-01-03). ""D24: Realistic Residence Times Studies"".

Optionally you can specify the size of them.   Media Files---Unfortunately not all browsers understand all video and audio formats. To mitigate the problem, you can upload your file in different formats for maximum browser compatibility. For example consider this embedded mp4 video: {{video.mp4|A funny video}} When you upload a video.webm and video.ogv next to the referenced video.mp4, DokuWiki will automatically add them as alternatives so that one of the three files is understood by your browser. Additionally DokuWiki supports a âposterâ? image which will be shown before the video has started. That image needs to have the same filename as the video and be either a jpg or png file. In the example above a video.jpg file would work. Lists Dokuwiki supports ordered and unordered lists. To create a list item, indent your text by two spaces and use a * for unordered lists or a - for ordered ones. This is a list The second item You may have different levels Another item The same list but ordered Another item Just use indention for deeper levels That's it  * This is a list *"

Each of the four players are in one of the corners of the screen guarded by a castle. You control a small shield which can be moved around the edge of the castle. To survive you need to use the shield to block a ball which bounces around the screen. If the ball hits your castle, it will take out some of the bricks. If a hole forms in the castle wall and the ball makes it though and hits your warlord, then you are out of the game. The last player left alive wins the battle, and the first player to win five battles wins the game! Several game options are included which allow you to either catch or ricochet the ball when the shield touches it, and control the speed---The Video Game Critic Jul 10, 2010 A 100 The Atari Times Sep 04, 2003 85 out of 100 85 neXGam Jun 27, 2013 8.3 out of 10 83 Tilt Sep, 1982 4 out of 6 67 [ addÂ review] Forums There are currently no topics for this game.

We still use the European way of sizing by height in centimeters because it's easy and makes good sense - since every child grows at their own pace all you need to do is measure their height for a good fit. There's no need to ""buy big."" Our clothes have plenty of growth room, so go ahead and order the correct size on our chart - there's no need to ""buy big."" We can't stress this enough! Whether you choose an item that's prewashed or one that has shrinkage built in, every hanna garment is designed for a good fit with room for growth. How to use our size chart: Just measure your child from the top of the head to the floor in inches, then use the chart to convert to centimeters. Call us with any questions and we'll be happy to help you get the right fit. Height is the one and only measure you need to order hannas - we can't stress this enough - measure the height for a good fit. Weight may be helpful if a child is above or below average weight. Age isn't nearly as accurate as using the height (since kids all grow at different rates!). It's helpful when sending out-of-town gifts.

"Foundry Manual - Part 2---","Foundry Manual - Part 2------when molten metal is poured into the mold. It is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the displaced molten metal. A core with dimensions of 12 inches by 12 inches by 12 inches, or one cubic foot, will weigh approximately 100 pounds. Immersed in molten gray iron, which weighs 450 pounds per cubic foot, the core will tend to remain in place until it has displaced 100 pounds of iron, and then it will tend to float. In order to keep it submerged (displacing 450 pounds of cast iron) it will be necessary to exert 350 pounds of force on it (450 - 100 = 350). It takes no more force to keep it submerged at greater depths than just below the surface. A greater head does not increase the lifting effect, although it does increase the pressure on the core. The ratio of 100 to 350, or 1 to 3.5, holds good for cores of any size, so we can make the rule that the force resulting from the tendency of a sand core to lift in cast iron is roughly 3.5 times its weight; for steel, 3.9 times; for copper, 4.5 times; etc. Where chaplets are used on large cores with extensive surface areas exposed to the metal, the usual practice is to use ordinary chaplets in the drag (since they are only required to hold the core in place until the metal is poured around them) and to---board and the ram-up board and turned over. The ram-up board (which is now on top) is removed and the mold face cleaned and slicked. Figure 82 shows the drag of the mold ready for the cope. A parting material is sprinkled over the mold joint and pattern. The parting material prevents the sand in the cope from sticking to the sand in the drag when the cope is rammed up. The parting material for large castings is usually fine silica sand. For medium and small castings, finely ground powders (such as talc or silica flour) are used. The cope of the flask is set on the drag and seated firmly with the aid of the flask pins. The cope pattern, riser forms, and any other parts of the gating system are set in their proper positions. Figure 83 shows the mold with the cope pattern, sprue, whirl-gate, and cross-gate pieces set. The facing sand is riddled into the cope and hand packed around corners and in deep pockets. At this point, any gaggers which are necessary are placed. Care should be taken not to set the gaggers too close to the pattern risers or parts of the gating system. Gaggers set too close to the mold surface will cause undesired chilling of the metal. Any mold showing exposed gagger s in the cope after the cope pattern has been drawn, should be shaken out and made over. The number of gaggers and supporting"

Photographer Johnny Tergo's 'drive-by' portraits: Digital Photography Review------}); MainSiteSearch(); { $(document).ready(function()---To take his curb-side portraits, LA-based photographer Johnny Tergo pulls up alongside his subjects and takes their photograph from his truck, using a remote-triggered Canon EOS-1D Mark IV rigged up to two studio lights. In an interview published by wired.com Tergo explains that as a freelance photographer he spends a lot of time on the road, and wanted to 'exploit his time behind the wheel' for a series of candid portraits of people going about their everyday lives. According to an interview published at wired.com, Tergo 'leads moving subjects by pulling forward slightly, waiting for them to enter the frame'. To achieve the studio-like lighting, Tergo has rigged his Chevy Silverado with two high-powered strobes, powered by twin 4000W generators in the truckbed. Inside, a Canon EOS-1D Mark IV is connected to a laptop, and triggered by a Pocket Wizard. Tergo has a dashboard-mounted iPhone for reviewing his shots via onboard Wi-Fi. On a normal day, Tergo claims to take '40 to 50' shots.Â  This is Johnny Tergo's Chevy Silverado truck, rigged up with two studio strobes and twin 4000W gas-powered generators which are nestled in the truckbed."

This joined project started in 2009 (one month of field trip), continued in 2010 (one month also) and will end in 2011. The two first years were mainly devoted to the prospecting of historical localities, some discovered and/or exploited by Dmitry Obruchev himself. Such a method is effective but quite time-consuming; i.e. to rediscover the accurate location of the localities by discussing with denizens, to fathom the archives out and to access to non-weathered layers by removing the altered surface. Novgorod and Leningrad Regions are topographically excessively flat. Devonian fields have not been disrupted by tectonic movements and the layers are thus horizontal. Rocks are most often quite unconsolidated (consisting of loose sands or clays) and excavations are thus relatively easy. The lack of relief and the vegetal cover unfortunately lead to few outcrops in the landscape. They are all located along rivers (Lovatâ, Syas' and Oredesh rivers for instance) or are represented by outliers. Although most of the localities were easily accessible by cars, others required several kilometers by feet and/or by boat."

"Breaking Out: Cincinnati Reds Outfielder Kyle Waldrop---","Breaking Out: Cincinnati Reds Outfielder Kyle Waldrop------Another thing that Waldrop noted was that he has had to force himself to use the entire field more, to go the other way. He isnât just saying that though, itâs actually happening. Here is his 2013 spray chart compared with one from 2014: Using the entire field Compared to the rest of his career the isolated power is the same as it has always been. That does ignore that he had a breakout power season in 2013 where his isolated power was at .202. Still, the current season mark of .172 isnât far off from that and heâs actually done better in Pensacola with a .189 mark. Itâs also worth noting that Pensacola does no favors for power to right field. .172 Total 2014 .189 Pensacola 2014 .157 Bakersfield 2014 .176 Before 2014 IsoP As noted above, the outfielder says he has stopped trying to hit a lot of home runs. While the home run total is down from the 2013 season where he hit 21 for Bakersfield---In 2014 the ball is going to center and left field a bit more often and it seems that itâs coming at the expense of the ball being pulled to first and second base. Overall Improvements With the improvements for Waldrop in 2014 there hasnât been one big reason for why heâs performed better. He hasnât begun walking at a very high clip. He hasnât found big time power that he didnât have before. He hasnât cut his strikeout rate in half. What he has done is make minor improvements to his offensive game nearly across the board and when combined they have made for a big improvement overall. Kyle Waldrop Share On: Tweet"
